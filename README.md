# Alberto Pastor portfolio

This is my personal portfolio running [jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) over [the theme particle](https://github.com/nrandecker/particle)

## Running the website in local

In order to compile the assets and run Jekyll on local you need to follow those steps:

- Install [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/)
- Run `npm install`
- Run `gulp`

## Credits

The jekyll theme used for designing this website has been made by @nrandecker using a [particle system made by VincentGarreu](https://github.com/willianjusten/will-jekyll-template) with inspiration on the [jekyll theme made by WillianJusten](https://github.com/willianjusten/will-jekyll-template).
