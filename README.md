# Alberto Pastor portfolio

This is my personal portfolio running jekyll over the theme [particle](https://github.com/nrandecker/particle)

## Running the website in local

In order to compile the assets and run Jekyll on local you need to follow those steps:

- Install [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/)
- Run `npm install`
- Run `gulp`

## Credits

The jekyll theme used for designing this website has been made by @nrandecker using a [particle system](https://github.com/willianjusten/will-jekyll-template) made by @VincentGarreu with the inspiration on the [jekyll theme](https://github.com/willianjusten/will-jekyll-template) made by @WillianJusten .
